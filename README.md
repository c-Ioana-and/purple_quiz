# Chromatica

This is a responsive quiz web app with a colorful animated background and dark mode support. The project features:
- Dynamic UI using animated gradient blobs as a background for a modern, playful look;
- Dark mode styling powered by new CSS color functions (lab(), oklab(), light-dark());
- Responsive design with min(), clamp(), and flexbox for smooth scaling across devices;
- Interactive quiz flow: start screen, progress tracking, scoring, and results screen;
- Clean, accessible UI with hover states and styled buttons for a polished experience.

I'm treating this project as a playground to experiment with new CSS features (like backdrop-filter, color spaces, and fluid typography) while keeping it practical and user-friendly :)
